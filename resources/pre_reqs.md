Prerequisites for mentored sprints
==================================

Python
------
For the mentored sprints we will be using [Python](https://www.python.org/).
Installing all of Python's research packages individually can be a bit
difficult, so we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) which 
provides a variety of useful packages/tools.

To download Anaconda, follow the link https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and select
Python 3. Following the download, run the installer as per usual on your machine.

Git
---
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control software that records changes
to a file or set of files. Git is especially helpful for software developers
as it allows changes to be tracked (including who and when) when working on a 
project.

To download Git, go to the following link and choose the correct version for your
operating system: https://git-scm.com/downloads.

GitHub
------
GitHub is a web-based service for version control using Git. You will need
to set up an account at https://github.com. Basic GitHub accounts are
free.

Text Editors
------------
Text editors are tools with powerful features designed to optimize writing code.
There are several text editors that you can choose from.
Here are some we recommend:

- Atom. Download at: https://atom.io.
- VS code. Download at: https://code.visualstudio.com/.
- Pycharm. Download at: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/.

We suggest trying several editors before settling on one.
