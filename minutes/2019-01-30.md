## Notes

### 1. Questions about the mentored sprints

- Are we going to need sponsorship for snacks or coffee? T.A to check with PyCon organisers if these are 
provided or if there are restrictions regarding getting sponsors
- Is there any chance we can get computers for the day? N.Z to check if we can get hold of some computers through work
- Do we need to create a Slack channel? - There _might_ be one for the sprints already so T.A will check with the organising team
and if so we can create a channel for the day `#mentored-sprints`
- Can we get some of the Python core developers interested? M.W to check with some of of the core devs 
- Create guidelines and processes to deal with harassment or similar issues on the day of the event 
- Do we need a Twitter account?

### 2. Submissions
We said we would open submissions right after the 7th of February
